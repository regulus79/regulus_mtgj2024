Note: I used the Fluid R3 GM sounfont to create the music, which is under CC0. I also used three default drum samples (kick04.ogg, clap01.ogg, and shaker01.ogg) from LMMS. I have heard rumours that the origins of these samples are unknown, and that the licensing is questionable, but since I am simply using them as minor percussive elements in my music, I believe it should count as transformative use.
